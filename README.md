# Dreamwidth Icon Table Generator

Webapp that instantly generates HTML that you can copy and paste to display your avatars/graphics in a nice, neat, numbered table on Dreamwidth (or anywhere that accepts HTML).

Uses HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and Javascript (jQuery).

## Features

* Adding image links one at a time
* Adding multiple image links at a time, separated by semicolons (;)
* Adding all images from an Imgur album thanks to integrating the Imgur API
* Table style customization
* Icon cell (spacing, background color) customization
* Numbering (big or small or regular font size, color) customization
* Ability to preview table

## Notes
* The table is centered by default. Remove <center> tags manually if you don't want that, and format as you will.
